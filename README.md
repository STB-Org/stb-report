# stb-report
Simple reviews of movies and games.

## Making a review (post)
Each review must fall in its respective folder, inside that folder's `_posts` folder.
The file name should be as follows: `yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-post.md`. Cover images should be placed
in the `img` folder.

Each review itself must follow the following format:
```
---
layout: post
title: "Title of Post"
date: yyyy-mm-dd
imgsrc: "name-of-cover-img.jpg"
---
The rest of your content goes here. It can use your typical Markdown syntax.
```
